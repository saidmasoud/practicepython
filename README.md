# Practice Python

----
## Introduction
These are solutions to the Python practice problems available [here](http://www.practicepython.org/). These solutions were done for practice and development of my Python skills. I highly recommend going to the site and trying out the practice problems on your own. The site also has solutions for the problems that you can compare with, along with the solutions found here.

Note: exercise 29 was skipped since the solution was implemented in exercise27.py.
